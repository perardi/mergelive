<h5>Why On-Demand?</h5>

<p>Our clients spoke and we listened. Following the 2012 Merge Live Client Conference in Chicago, our attendees told us that budgets are tighter than ever, their discretionary travel is being scrutinized and that it's hard to get away for three days given the cost and productivity pressures they are under. We hope that by going online, more clients can take advantage of all of the awesome educational opportunities and make even more connections online!</p>

<h5>When does registration open?</h5>
